Theoretical question:
As a client, at the first time you got a token. You have 2 options:
a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again.

write at least 1 pro and 1 con for each implementation (a) & (b), in your git repository in a file named "theoretical_question.txt".

Answer:
option 1: save in sp - 
* pro - much easier and straight forward, saves up the server callings in every app launch.
* con - less secure.

option 2: re-request token from server - 
* pro - secured (espacially if we use https protocol), since the token is generated randomly by the server.
* con - takes more time since we need to call the distant server and wait for response.
